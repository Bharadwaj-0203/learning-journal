                I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects

            <p class="more-journal-content content-one"><strong>How I stay committed to learning</strong>
                <br><br>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning,
                then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing 
                projects.While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning 
                and most things about my journey with the world.
                <br><br>
                <strong>How I got started</strong>
                <br><br>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal 
                site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use 
                my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I 
                learned using my own words.That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that 
                posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
